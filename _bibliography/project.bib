abstract={This system uses a Depth Camera, Millimeter Wave Radar, and Thermal Sensor to accurately detect falls in real-time within settings like nursing homes. Key features: Depth Camera: Creates a 3D representation of the environment, detecting falls based on changes in a person's relative position. Millimeter Wave Radar: Detects minute movements and works effectively even in low light conditions or when the person is out of camera view. Thermal Sensor: Identifies heat signature changes when a person falls and remains on the floor. Highly reliable and respectful of personal privacy, our system has proven effective in enhancing elderly care by enabling swift responses to falls.},
