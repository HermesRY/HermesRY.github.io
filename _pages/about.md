Hi! I am currently a Research Assistant in the <a href="https://aiot.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/" style="font-weight: 400;">AIoT Lab</a>, in the <a href="https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/" style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Information Engineering</a>, at <a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html" style="font-weight: 400;">The Chinese University of Hong Kong</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://staff.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~glxing/" style="font-weight: 400;">Prof.Guoliang Xing.</a>

My research interests align closely with developing **Artificial Intelligence Systems**, specifically focusing on developing privacy-preserving machine learning and sensing systems for smart health applications. I also have extensive experience in deploying large-scale real-world **smart health** systems, particularly for <a href="https://cuhk-alzheimers-ai.github.io/" style="font-weight: 400;">monitoring Alzheimer's Disease</a>. Our work in this area has been instrumental in bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical application, contributing significantly to the digital health landscape.

I obtined my Master degree from Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2022. I received my B.E. degree with honor from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2021. My Bachelor's major was Information Engineering with a minor in **Web and Cloud Computing** from the Department of Computer Science.
