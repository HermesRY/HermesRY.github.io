Professor Xingâ€™s research lies at the intersection between systems, embedded AI, algorithms, and physical domains including health, autonomous driving, and environment. His research group develops new technologies at the frontier of mobile health, autonomous driving, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), wireless networks, security and privacy. Several mobile technologies developed in his lab have been successfully transferred to the industry. Prof. Xing led the development of several large-scale systems for smart lampposts, Alzheimer's Disease monitoring, and volcano monitoring. For details of his research, please visit the homepage of <a href="https://aiot.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/" style="font-weight: 500;">AIoT Lab.</a> We are looking for motivated students and researchers to join us, see openings <a href="https://aiot.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/openings.html" style="font-weight: 500;">here.</a>
